# Path-Dependent-Attenuation-Ground-Motion-Field-in-Volcanic-Areas

This project aims to combine two ground motion fields with different levels of attenuation, according to the distrubution of volcanic areas.

It requires data produced by openquake engine(https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/master/manual/getting-started/installation-instructions/index.html#installing-the-long-term-support-lts-version).
